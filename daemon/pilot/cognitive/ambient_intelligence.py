"""Ambient Intelligence Mode — proactive suggestions based on cognitive state.

This module implements the second revolutionary feature:
- Monitors cognitive state continuously
- Detects patterns that suggest user needs help
- Proactively suggests actions BEFORE the user asks
- Context-aware: considers time, task complexity, stress levels
- "What-If" predictions: anticipates next steps

Architecture:
  Cognitive Monitor → Pattern Detector → Need Predictor → Proactive Suggestion Engine → User Response
